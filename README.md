## Introduction

Vlackjack is an HTML5 blackjack game with only four production dependencies:
- [vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [babel-polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/)

## Blackjack Rules

Vlackjack follows many common casino rules for Blackjack with a few exceptions.  Insurance against dealer blackjack is not offered.  You may double down on any hand or split any pair, but you can not re-split.  Betting is simplified to one "coin" at the start of each hand, and blackjack pays 2-to-1.  The game is written to use six decks of cards, but it generously only shuffles after 75% of the cards have been played.

## Known Issues

Vlackjack has only been in development for a very short time, so please bear with me.
- IE11 rendering is pretty bad
- A bankrupt/restart screen is still needed
- Splitting could use some finesse
- Responsiveness, particularly font scaling, is not perfect
- Need a lot more tests
